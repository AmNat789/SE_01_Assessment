# SE_01_Assessment

####This python project was written in Python 3.9.6. Using other versions may not work as intended

This repository stores three versions of the **Sliding Puzzles Game**, 
at varying levels of complexity, based on the tasks assigned for the SE_01 Assessment

Note: You will need the **clone** module to run the files. 
However, this module is part of the standard python installation, 
so you will most likely not be required to download this module separately

To run any of these files, type the following command into the terminal.
```shell
> python FILE_NAME
```

For example, for **task_1.py**, write the following on the console
```shell
> python task_1.py
```
